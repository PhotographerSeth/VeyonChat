VeyonChat Plugin - Next Steps
You now have a solid foundation for your Veyon Chat plugin. Here's how to move forward and a few questions to consider.

1. Setting Up Your Build Environment
This is the most critical step. A Veyon plugin needs to be compiled against the Veyon source code.

Get Veyon Source: Clone the official Veyon repository from GitHub to your development machine.

Build Veyon: Follow the official Veyon documentation to build it from the source. This will generate the necessary header files (.h) and libraries (.lib/.dll or .so) that your plugin needs to link against.

Configure VeyonChat.pro: Open the VeyonChat.pro file. You must update the VEYON_INCLUDE_PATH and VEYON_LIBRARY_PATH variables to point to the correct directories inside the folder where you built Veyon.

2. Compiling Your Plugin
Install Qt: You'll need the Qt development tools (including Qt Creator IDE) installed. Make sure to use the same version Veyon is built with (check their documentation).

Open Project: Open VeyonChat.pro in Qt Creator.

Build: Configure the project for a "Release" build and click the build button. If the paths in the .pro file are correct, it should compile successfully, creating a VeyonChat.dll (Windows) or libVeyonChat.so (Linux) file.

3. Deploying and Testing
Copy Files: Copy the compiled library file (.dll or .so) and the plugin.json file into a new sub-folder (e.g., VeyonChat) inside Veyon's plugins directory.

Windows: C:\Program Files\Veyon\plugins\VeyonChat\

Linux: /usr/lib/veyon/plugins/VeyonChat/

Run Veyon Master: Start Veyon Master. Look in the toolbar for your new "Chat" icon! When you click it with a client selected, your (currently empty) chat window should appear.

4. Implementing the Core Logic (Your TODOs)
The generated code contains placeholder comments (// TODO: and pseudo-code) where you need to implement the actual communication logic. This is your main programming task.

Veyon RPC: The key is to use Veyon's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system. This is how the Master and Client will exchange messages securely through the existing Veyon connection. You will need to research Veyon::Core::RemoteProcedureCall in the Veyon source code.

Master to Client: In MasterChatDialog.cpp, you'll use something like clientManager()->executeRemoteProcedureCall() to send a message to a specific client.

Client to Master: In ClientChatDialog.cpp, you'll use serviceConnection()->executeRemoteProcedureCall() to send a reply back to the Master.

Receiving RPCs: You'll need to register handlers on both sides to listen for incoming RPCs and call the appropriate functions (e.g., displayMessage).
